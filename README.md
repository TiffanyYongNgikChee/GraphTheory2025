# Graph Theory Assignment

This repository contains code for my Graph Theory assignment, covering:

## Part 1 – Likely Isomorphic
- Checks whether two graphs are likely isomorphic based on:
  1. Equal number of vertices
  2. Equal number of edges
  3. Same degree sequences
  4. Same sorted adjacency degrees list

## Part 2 – Bipartite Graphs
- Detects if a graph is bipartite and, if so, returns a bipartition.

## Assignment 2 – Graph Isomorphisms
- Implements four methods to determine isomorphisms using mappings, adjacency translation, and permutation matrices.
